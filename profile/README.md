<details><summary><h2>🌟 Future Plans</h2></summary>

what i wanna do later

<details><summary><h3>Use Godot</h3></summary>

- I know a little, but not much  
- Want to make actual games for Steam or something  
- Maybe even make some $$$  
- (I am broke)  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Panda TD 2 X</h3></summary>

- Maybe someday  
- Probably in Godot instead of JavaScript  
- Basically Panda TD but actually a *real* game  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Flippy Tile 2</h3></summary>

- A sequel to Flippy Tile  
- This time, an actual game, not just a toy website  
- Might be in Godot, might stay in JS (since online multiplayer makes sense for this)
