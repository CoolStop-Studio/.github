<details><summary><h2>Projects</h2></summary>

A list of all projects I've made:

<details><summary><h3>Flippy Tile</h3></summary>

- A fun and simple game about flipping tiles  
- A static page with no internet connection required  
- Great for speedrunning  
- Make the whole grid the same color to win  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>GDS Chat</h3></summary>

- A cool, easy-to-use chat app with no email required  
- Just a username and password, then you can message anybody  
- No censorship, limitations, or moderation  
- Group chats and a ton of settings! (GDS Chat 4)  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Gary's RNG</h3></summary>

- A fun game about rolling for random chances

<details><summary><h2>Future Plans</h2></summary>

<details><summary><h3>Use Godot</h3></summary>

- I have some experience, but not much  
- Want to make real games on Steam or something  
- Maybe actually make some $$$  
- (Sorry, I’m poor)  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Panda TD 2 X</h3></summary>

- Far future  
- Maybe create it with Godot or a real language (not JS)  
- More like PT2 but not in Scratch, plus other stuff  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Flippy Tile 2</h3></summary>

- Sequel to Flippy Tile  
- An actual game, not just a toy website to mess around with  
- Maybe in Godot, maybe in JS (probably JS since an online game makes more sense for this)  

</details>

<details><summary><h2>About Me</h2></summary>

- Fresh web game developer  
- Unprofessional  
- I hate JS but don’t really want to learn a different language, so I keep using it

<details><summary><h2>My Questions About Life</h2></summary>

- Why would anyone use VS2022 when VS Code exists?  
- Why doesn’t Windows have the built-in ability to compile & run C and C++?  
- Why does CSS have to be so dumb?  
- Who thought JavaScript error messages should be so pointless?  
- How do I get traction on my projects?  
- Why am I still writing these?  
- Why am I even putting so much effort into this README when nobody will see it anyway?
