<details><summary><h2>🚀 Projects</h2></summary>

Here’s the stuff I’ve actually finished (or at least finished *enough* to move on).  

<details><summary><h3>Flippy Tile</h3></summary>

- A simple game about flipping tiles  
- No internet required, just a static page  
- Great for speedrunning  
- Make the whole grid the same color to win  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>GDS Chat</h3></summary>

- A chat app that doesn’t ask for an email  
- Just pick a username and password, then message people  
- No censorship, no limitations, no moderation  
- Group chats + a ton of settings (GDS Chat 4)  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Gary’s RNG</h3></summary>

- A game about rolling for random chances  
- Has an inventory system to track everything you’ve rolled  
- Inspired by Sol’s RNG

<details><summary><h2>🛠️ Works in Progress</h2></summary>

These are the things I’m *currently* working on (or at least thinking about working on).  

<details><summary><h3>OrBit - Online Interpreter</h3></summary>

- An interpreter for a programming language I made  
- Kinda like TypeScript but different  
- Has “Modifiers” that change how variables work  
- Built to be logical and predictable (unlike JavaScript)  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Panda TD X</h3></summary>

- A tower defense game about pandas and bamboo  
- Originally a Scratch game I made, now ported to JS  
- My most ambitious project so far  

</details>

<details><summary><h2>🌟 Future Plans</h2></summary>

Things I *might* do if I ever feel like it.  

<details><summary><h3>Use Godot</h3></summary>

- I know a little, but not much  
- Want to make actual games for Steam or something  
- Maybe even make some $$$  
- (I am broke)  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Panda TD 2 X</h3></summary>

- Maybe someday  
- Probably in Godot instead of JavaScript  
- Basically Panda TD but actually a *real* game  

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Flippy Tile 2</h3></summary>

- A sequel to Flippy Tile  
- This time, an actual game, not just a toy website  
- Might be in Godot, might stay in JS (since online multiplayer makes sense for this)

<details><summary><h2>🤔 My Questions About Life</h2></summary>

- Why would anyone use VS2022 when VSCode exists
- Why doesn’t Windows come with a built-in way to run C and C++
- Why CSS exist so bad
- Who designed JavaScript error messages
- How do I actually get traction on my projects  
- Why am I still writing these
- Why am I putting so much effort into this README that nobody will see anyway
